# About Me

Hi! I'm Negin (legally Fatemeh Heiran) 🌿  
Think of me like a little bird that never stays on one branch for too long - curious, restless, and always exploring. But no matter where I go, I never forget where home is.  

Right now, I’m a **robotics engineer, interdisciplinary researcher, and founder-in-progress**.  

### 🔭 What I’m working on
- **[Estella Humanoid Robot](https://github.com/EstellaHumanoids/Humanoid-Robot)**  
  An open-source humanoid inspired by human anatomy. Currently featuring lifelike **facial expressions**, a **spine system**, a **neck module**, and **shoulders**, Estella is built to explore the intersection of robotics, design, and human interaction.  
- **Painverse Telemedicine Robotics System**  
  A platform for remote medical assessment, blending robotics with healthcare innovation.  

### 🌱 What I’m focusing on
Improving both my **technical expertise** (robot design, control, prototyping) and my **spiritual growth** — a balance that keeps me moving forward.  

### 👯 What I’m looking for
PhD opportunities in **Robotics** or **Mechatronics**, where I can expand on humanoid design, control systems, and expressive robotics.  

### 💬 Ask me about
Humanoid robots, mechanism design, kinematics, dynamics, control theory, prototyping, and bringing ideas to life through engineering.

### ⚡ Fun fact
I call myself a dreamer, but others say I’m a hard worker — maybe the truth is somewhere in between.
