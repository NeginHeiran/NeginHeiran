# About me

Hi! I'm Negin (legally Fatemeh Heiran)! You might find me a bit odd, like a little bird that just canâ€™t stay on one branch; but I never forget where home is! Right now I'm a robotics engineer, dreamer and founder in progress.
1. ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Estella Humanoid Robot, focusing on realistic facial expressions using advanced kinematics, and Painverse Telemedicine Robotics System, focusing on remote medical assessment.
2. ðŸŒ± My current focus is on improving my technical and spritual skills.
3. ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for PhD position in Robotics or Mechatronics.
4. ðŸ’¬ Ask me about humanoid robots, mechanism design, kinematics, dynamics, controller design, mechanical design, and product prototyping.
