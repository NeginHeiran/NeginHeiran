# About me

Hi! I'm Negin (legally Fatemeh Heiran)! You might find me a bit oddâ€”like a little bird that just canâ€™t stay on one branchâ€¦ but I never forget where home is! Right now I'm a robotics engineer, dreamer and founder in progress.
1. ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Estella Humanoid Robot Face, focusing on realistic facial expressions using advanced kinematics, and Painverse Telemedicine Robotics System, focusing on remote medical assessment.
2. ðŸŒ± My current focus is on improving my technical and spritual skills.
3. ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on humanoid robot development, telerobotics systems, and startup development.
4. ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with fundraising for robotics and telemedicine projects.
5. ðŸ’¬ Ask me about humanoid robots, mechanism design, kinematics, dynamics, controller design, mechanical design, and product prototyping. On the business side, I have good ideas and experiences in business development and organization administration.
